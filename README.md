## Summary
    Pewlett Hackard will need to be gearing itself up to replace around 72458 employees. At this time there aren't enough staff members eligible for the mentorship program to replace them. The company will need to consider replacing the employees using external sources or allowing individuals from other unrelated teams to develop their skills in order to fill these spaces.
